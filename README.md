# Pomora
Pomora is a website that is designed around the Pomodoro-Technique. It consists of a timer, task tracker, and activity tracker that are all interactive for the user.

This project was made under the principles of HCI through my subject on CIT205.

It was built using HTML, CSS, and JS technologies.

Pomora logo and format was designed through Figma by me.
